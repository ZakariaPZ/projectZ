				Painted on the night’s twinkling canvas is a disturbing picture. The magnificence of life is  dwarfed as the infinite stretch of space and time suggest mankind’s presence is rather trivial – even gratuitous. Our tiny eyes gaze into a scintillating backdrop, and returned to them is the cold, indifferent, and merciless stare of a lifeless universe. It is the first time one sees something bigger than himself, and it dawns upon him that he is no different than the dust he is perched atop. In the face of such an unrelenting display of grandeur, it may feel as if the dazzling nature of life evaporates to reveal the fleeting merit of each soul. Such a sentiment is reaffirmed by our confinement in an iota of the observable universe, lacking any causal power in a cage where even light must bask in eternal darkness. It is most disheartening to think that our insignificance is intimately tied to our intrinsic weakness, forever fated to be hostage to our unyielding condition. In due course, the illusion of company is stripped to reveal the ironic loneliness of a man and his several billion neighbours.

				And yet even the grand universe is fated to live a finite existence, along with all that it contains. The joys, triumphs, and compassions that fill life with allure are slowly erased as every trace of our being vanishes from this suicidal universe. Today we are strangers to nothingness; tomorrow we become its closest companion as we are chauffeured away from our existence. The moments between birth and death are but a handful. Even a life composed into the greatest of symphonies is not sheltered from oblivion. It is sung once, never to be heard again. Time – a pitiless messenger reminding us of the vanity in every facet of life. Emerging from an abyss of unknown history, racing through our terrifyingly brief lives and burying us into the past – one which is destined to be forgotten. Transfixed by the hollow nature underscoring his life, one wonders, <span id = "question">“was it all for naught?”</span>...Without an answer, the echoes are lost in the universe’s everlasting silence.

			<p id = "Paragraph3">The universe is as grand as life is short. Yet perhaps that vastness and brevity come together not to evoke despair, but instead to urge us to seek a most colourful existence. The vast universe allows each to be entangled in a romance of his own. The passing of time allows tomorrow to be unlike today. Together, they gift us the opportunity to enjoy a presence larger than the ever-expanding universe. Meaning lies not in the infinite gaps of darkness which fill us with misery; it is right here on this blue mote hurtling through that emptiness. And while the wisdom behind our finite lives remains elusive, we can be certain that it was not for us to lament on our weakness. </p>

There, a fragile, elfin, velvety existence colours in a space so small, yet so profound. </p>
